                     Kemari in Japan (as early as the 7th century AD), a non-competitive game emphasizing skill and elegance.
                     Episkyros in ancient Greece, and later Harpastum in ancient Rome, involved more physical contact and may have influenced European medieval games. 
                     Indigenous cultures in the Americas, such as the Maya and Aztec civilizations, also played ball games, although many of these had religious or ritual significance and were not direct predecessors to modern football.
