                     Episkyros in ancient Greece, and later Harpastum in ancient Rome, involved more physical contact and may have influenced European medieval games. 
                     Indigenous cultures in the Americas, such as the Maya and Aztec civilizations, also played ball games, although many of these had religious or ritual significance and were not direct predecessors to modern football.

                <p>Passing is the most basic yet important aspect of football. Passing involves using the insole of your feet to
                    hit and pass the ball to your teammate.

                    a maximum of 22 players on the pitch. With each team kicking off the match with 11 players. 
                    Each team may assign one designated goalkeeper per team, who can use their hands within the penalty area to catch or deflect the ball.

                    Misconduct can lead to disciplinary actions like yellow or red cards, and even match suspensions in more serious cases. When a player is contesting for the ball 
                    and cause the player to trip but is fully targetting the ball, it is not considered a foul.
                    Two yellow cards equate to a red card.
